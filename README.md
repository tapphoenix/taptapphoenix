# Tap Tap Phoenix
Tap Tap Revenge remake compatible with AltStore for iOS

#### We're working on a new rhythm game for iOS
We're currently working on a new rhythm game for iOS that will be listed in the AltStore. To help with this, we've set up a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/taptapphoenix) page where you can donate to support development (or just show your appreciation for Tap Tap Phoenix). Of course you're not required to donate to download Tap Tap Phoenix but any support would be greatly appreciated! 

# How to Downloaad
Make sure you have AltStore installed on your device and AltSever on your computer. For instructions on how to install AltStore, visit [AltStore.io](https://altstore.io). There's two ways to install through AltStore depending on which version you have. Following the guide below for your correct version.

- **BETA VERSION**
  - Add the repo to your sources
  - Search Tap Tap Phoenix
  - Tap "Install"
  
- **STABLE VERSION**
  - Tap here to visit the Releases page on your device
  - Tap "taptapphoenix.ipa" and then "Save to Files"
  - Open Files app on your iPhone and find the IPA file you just downloaded
  - Tap on the file and then open with AltStore (you may have to scroll to the right and click "More" for AltStore to appear)
  
If after this instructions you're still not sure how to install the game, please let us know and we will try to help you as much as possible. However, before that, please read through the FAQs section on the official AltStore website. It answers most questions you may have. There's also the [AltStore subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AltStore/) with even more information on using the AltStore.
  
# How to Play
As the notes fall from the top of the screen, time your taps when the notes line up with the oval which spaces near the bottom. The more notes you successfully tap, the higher your combo will rise. The higher the combo, the higher the points are for each note.

There are two types of notes:
  - Normal circular notes - tap on these notes
  - Arrow notes - shake your device in the direction they're pointing instead of tapping on them
  
Once you see the word "Revenge" appear on the screen, shake your device to activate "Revenge Mode". In this mode, the background will turn blue and you'll activate 8x combo mode which will give you more points for each tap.

# Submitting Your Score
When you first launch the game you will be greeted with a prompt telling you to create an account. While this isn't necessary to play the game, it is highly recommended. You can do this by visiting the Options menu and tapping "Create Account". When you do this, you will be able to register your high score after each completed song. Without the account, you won't be able to register your score.

**Note on changing devices:**
If you switch devices at any time, you can relink your account by visiting the Options menu and tapping "Login".

Once your account is created/you login, you won't have to do this again on the current device unless you remove the account.

# Things That Are Missing
Some things have been cut from this fan game that the original Tap Tap included. For example, there's no two player mode. There's also no multiplayer mode. We considered adding these things but made the decision to cut them due to time and (mainly) the engine we used to create this game. We would love to add them in the future, but our main focus will be on our next project.

# Bugs
While we tried to find and squash as many bugs as possible during development, there's bound to be a few hidden away as this is the initial release. If you find any, don't hesitate to let us know so we can track them down and fix them.

# Copyright Notice
As you can see, this is basically a clone of the original Tap Tap Revenge by Tapulous (now owned by Disney). It includes assets created by Tapulous as well as various musical artists. We don't mean to infringe on their copyrights and this is why the game is free. It's a fan project to show love and respect for what we consider one of the greats iOS games ever released. If you're one of the copyright holders for an asset in the game, we hope you understand where we're coming from and allow the game to stay up. However, if you don't, let us know and we'll respect your wishes and remove the download.
